# RPG - Dragon Repeller

## Overview
This is the completed development of my first mini game! I have completed the frontend stack of this browser-based mini-game with the combination of HTML and CSS files linked to a JavaScript file.

This project is a simple role-playing game (RPG) titled "Dragon Repeller". The game involves a player navigating through different locations, fighting monsters, and gathering resources like health, gold, and experience points (XP). The objective is to defeat the dragon preventing people from leaving the town.

- Divisions for game stats, controls, and monster stats.
- Buttons for actions like going to different locations and fighting.
- Dynamic text area for game narrative and actions.
- Link to the `styles.css` for styling and `script.js` for game logic.

### styles.css
